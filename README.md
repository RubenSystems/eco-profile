EcoProfiler is at the forefront of promoting sustainability in the technology industry. Our focus is profiling distributed systems to understand the environmental impact of their services and find ways to reduce them.

EcoProfile uses a combination of data analysis, metrics and advanced machine learning algorithms to measure the energy consumption associated with technology services. The company tracks energy usage across different parts of its infrastructure, including servers, data centres, and network equipment, and uses this data to detect anomalies and predict future energy consumption.

By incorporating machine learning into its profiling process, EcoProfile can provide its clients with even more accurate and detailed insights into their environmental impact. We can identify areas for improvement, helping our clients to make more informed decisions that support their sustainability goals.
